# Hi there! 👋 I'm Zoha Jamil

## 🌟 About Me 🌟

🎓 I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from FAST-NUCES in 2019, and I've been working as a Full Stack Developer for the past four years. My focus has mainly been on creating websites and web applications.

💻 I'm skilled in a variety of tools and technologies like React, Next.js, Redux, Angular, Node.js, Nest.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, MongoDB, Firebase, GitHub, and SQL.

🏅 Additionally, I hold a certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner.

✨ Currently, I'm involved in a project that arranges auctions. It allows sellers to list items for auction, set starting prices, and allow buyers to bid on those items until the auction ends. It's an exciting opportunity where I'm applying my expertise in React, Next, Nest, Typescript and Mongodb. Moreover, I handle occasional tasks involving database migration, which I manage using pyMongo.

🚀 I'm comfortable working in agile environments, and I use tools like JIRA and Clickup to keep track of project progress. I'm also familiar with both Linux and Windows operating systems.

🌍 I have experience working with clients from different parts of the world, and I enjoy helping and guiding junior developers on the team.

🔍 I'm particularly interested in working with MEAN/MERN stack, and I'm excited to continue growing as a Full Stack Developer in this field.
